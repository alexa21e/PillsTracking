# PillsTracking

Pills Tracking  is an app I am currently developing for my Software Engineering course. It has a .NET8 server-side with an SQL database for two clients. The web-side running on Angular framework it’s meant for admins and doctors, to handle patients and their prescriptions. The mobile-side
respresents the patients’ app, running on React Native and it is supposed to show patients their prescriptions and send them notifications as reminders to take their pills.









## How to use the web-side

You first have to login with the pre-made admin role:

e-mail: admin@localhost.com
password: Pa$$w0rd

Then to continue to use the app, you need to add doctors or admins. After that, you can log out and register as doctor or admin using one of the emails used earlier

After registering you gain access in the app. If you registered as doctor:

- In the home page or My patients page, you can see the patients in your list, delete them from your list and see their details

- If clicking on a patient, you will be redirected to the details page of a patient, you can see more info about it and add prescriptions

- If clicking on a prescription, you can see its details

- In All patients page available on the navigation bar you will see the patients registered in our database and you will be able to add them in your list
